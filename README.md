I'm a passionate developer, that loves to teach others all my knwoledge.

I've had the opportunity to participate on world class projects :globe_with_meridians:

Such as BBVA Smart Assistant, chatbots and many more. :robot:

I'm co-lead of the Facebook Developer Circles CDMX community and I really like to help a lot of communities, not only on Mexico, but around the world.
